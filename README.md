# Predicting the future price of ETH

A support vector regression (SVR) model and LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) are implemented to predict future prices of the ETH cryptocurrency based on daily historical data.

The SVR model was implemented using scikit-learn, and also involves the standard NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for working with data.

Moreover, the Optuna library is used to automate the model's hyperparameter tuning before it trains to maximize accuracy.

# To do:
Implement LSTM RNN to predict prices and compare results with SVR
